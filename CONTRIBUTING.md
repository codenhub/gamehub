## How to contribute

## Best practices

- Use TypeScript whenever possible
- Keep consistency with the existing code style
- Avoid overly large commits
- Prefer readable code over clever code
- Comments are welcome when they help explain decisions

## Games, assets, and content

- Games and assets may use their own licenses, as long as they are compatible
- Do not include assets without a clear license
- If in doubt, ask before opening a Pull Request

## Network use (AGPL)

If you modify this project and make it publicly available as a web service,
the AGPLv3 requires that the source code of those modifications be made available to users.

This ensures that improvements to the hub remain open and benefit the community.

## Questions?

Open an issue.
It’s better to ask than to assume.
